# Career (Software Engineering)

## Notes

- [most developers hit a point where the impact they can have is rate-limited by other developers and nondevelopers. This can result in a career change to engineering management or architect role. This can even get to the point where you are making a mistake if you are coding at all.](https://www.swyx.io/strategy-turns/)
